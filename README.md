# ML-Multiclass-Car-Classification
A machine learning project that applies classification models to predict car evaluations using the Car Evaluation Dataset from the UCI ML Repository. The project explores Decision Tree, k-NN, Logistic Regression, Na√Øve Bayes, and SVM, with nested cross-validation, hyperparameter tuning, and ROC analysis.
